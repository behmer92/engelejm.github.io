    <p>Hello! My name is Jessica, I am 24 years old, 
and am from Saskatchewan, Canada.
Three years ago, after 30 hours of 
driving with my cat, I arrived in Cincinnati
Ohio! I am about to graduate from the 
College Conservatory of Music here at UC
with a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Media, 
with a minor in Information Technology. I 
am a digital storyteller, primarily using Adobe
 Creative Suite products and Maya to make
original content. In fact, every element on 
this site was made by me! I love working with 
various mediums, diving into something new, 
and collaborating with other creators!
I am energetic, creative, and ultimately,
